"""
This program implements a todo list application.
This program allows us to print the list, add new todo, delete an existing todo,
and set the todo status to be completed.

The program uses two global dictionary variables to track the todo items.
First dict called "tasks", has key of task id, and value of task description.
Second dict called "stats", has key of task id, and value of task status.
Boolean value True stands for completed, boolean False means not completed.

Examples of two dictionaries look like the followings:
tasks = {1: "Do homework", 2: "Clean room"}
stats = {1: False, 2: True}

def create_task(description):
    """
    Function create_task is used to add a new task into the application.
    Since dictionaries 'tasks' and 'stats' share the same task id, a new
    task id must be generated first.
    If currently no task, we assign 1 to the new task id.
    If currently one or more tasks exist, we get the maximum key of all tasks,
    and then adding 1 to the max key to get the new task id.

    Afterwards, add entry to both dictionaries.
